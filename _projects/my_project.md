## Introduction

Tanya Iudenich (9th grade of high school, Tashkent) in a personal letter to Stalin:
      Joseph Vissarionovich!  
      I want to ask you:
      Help me and show it!
      How to become 
      A Soviet poet!!!
      
Maria Beletskaia (24 years, Stavropolskii region) in a personal letter to People’s Commissariat for Education Andrei Bubnov:
"…12 years I’ve been racking my brain with vain thoughts, but it won’t help… In my brain there is so much thought, but I cannot put in on paper, and all because I did not study…"

The Writers’ Union resolution stated: “As can be seen from the second excerpt, the girl still does not have a good command of the Russian language. In her letter there are many spelling mistakes, but she has a great desire for knowledge.” People want to learn! The workers of the numerous literary clubs (litkruzhki) have a strong desire to make their contribution to the socialist construction by creating of high-quality artistic works, they want to reflect in literature the heroic struggles of the builders of socialism. But here is a problem. The workers lack culture and literary techniques. That is what motivates (at least officially on paper) the Soviet Writers’ Union to organize the Evening Workers’ Literary University, VRLU[^1] in Moscow in 1933. The enterprise turned out to be enormously successful: its predecessors could not last more than 4-5 years, but VRLU survived the purges, it survived the war, in 1946 it was renamed the Gorky Literary Institute, and it still exists today under the same name after nine decades and the education of countless celebrated Soviet and Russian authors.
